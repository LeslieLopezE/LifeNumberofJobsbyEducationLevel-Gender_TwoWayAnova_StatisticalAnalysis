# Numberofjobsby-educationlevel and genger_TwoWayAnova_StatisticalAnalysis

One measure of the health of a national economy is how quickly it creates jobs. One aspect of this
issue is the number of jobs individual hold. As part of a study on job tenure, a survey
was conducted wherein Americans aged between 17 and 45 were asked how many jobs they
have held in their lifetimes. Also recorded were gender and educational attainment.

The categories are:

*Less than high school (E1)

*High school (E2)

*Some college/university but not degree (E3)

*At least one university (E4)

This hypothesis testing will determine the existence of the following interactions and/or differences:

A.Interaction between gender and education in holding jobs.
B.Differences in holding jobs between men and women.
C.Differences in holding jobs between the educational levels.

## Hyphotesis

H0: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for all Education Level Groups are equal

Ha: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for all Education Level Groups are
different

H0: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for the 2 Genders are equal

Ha: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for the 2 genders are different

H0: There is no interaction between Education Level and Gender

Ha: There is interaction between Education Level and Gender

## Findings and Conclusions

1. Since P value is less than 0.05, there is a significant variation in jobs in the samples
taken (various Education grousps and 2 Genders)

2.Because P value is greater than 0.05, we conclude that there is not variation in
the number of jobs held by the 2 groups of gender.

3.From the above 2 plots, there is not associated pattern between Means and Means by Educational Level
From the LSMeans Matrix, we can see the none of the P values are less than 0.05 for the 4 Education Levels, thus we
conclude that there is no interaction between Education Level and Gender
