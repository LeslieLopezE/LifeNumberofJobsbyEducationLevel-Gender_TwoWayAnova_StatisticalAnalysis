# Number of jobs by Education Level and Gender - Two-way Annova Analysis

One measure of the health of a national economy is how quickly it creates jobs. One aspect of this
issue is the number of jobs individual hold. As part of a study on job tenure, a survey
was conducted wherein Americans aged between 17 and 45 were asked how many jobs they
have held in their lifetimes. Also recorded were gender and educational attainment.

The categories are:

*Less than high school (E1)

*High school (E2)

*Some college/university but not degree (E3)

*At least one university (E4)

This hypothesis testing will determine the existence of the following interactions and/or differences:

A.Interaction between gender and education in holding jobs.
B.Differences in holding jobs between men and women.
C.Differences in holding jobs between the educational levels.

## Hyphotesis

A.Interaction between gender and education in holding jobs.

H0: There is no interaction between Education Level and Gender

Ha: There is interaction between Education Level and Gender


B.Differences in holding jobs between men and women.

H0: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for the 2 Genders are equal

Ha: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for the 2 genders are different


C.Differences in holding jobs between the educational levels.

H0: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for all Education Level Groups are equal

Ha: The means of jobs(numbers of jobs) for all Education Level Groups are
different


## Findings and Conclusions


A.Interaction between gender and education in holding jobs.

From the above 2 plots, there is not associated pattern between Means and Means by Educational Level
From the LSMeans Matrix, we can see the none of the P values are less than 0.05 for the 4 Education Levels, thus we
conclude that there is no interaction between Education Level and Gender


B.Differences in holding jobs between men and women.

Because P value is greater than 0.05, we conclude that there is not variation in
the number of jobs held by the 2 groups of gender.


C.Differences in holding jobs between the educational levels.

Since P value is less than 0.05, there is a significant variation in jobs in the samples
taken accross various Education grousps
